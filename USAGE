This instructions assume both DECAF and TFD are properly installed, 
otherwise check INSTALL.

How to (quickly) collect a trace using TFD: 

  0. Start DECAF (see INSTALL)

  1. Load TFD plugin
  (qemu) load_plugin TFD_PATH/tfd.so

  2. Specify received network data as a taint source.
  (qemu) taint_nic 1

  3. Identify the PID of the process to trace. 
     To list all running processes:
       a) in a Windows image: (qemu) guest_ps
       b) in a Linux image: (qemu) linux_ps

  4. Start tracing the victim process.
  (qemu) trace <pid_of_victim_process> <trace_filename>

  5. After the experiment, stop tracing and collect the trace.
  (qemu) trace_stop


Tracing a process from the start
================================
If you want to trace a process from the start, then the PID is unknown. 
To trace, then replace steps 3. and 4. above with:

  3. (qemu) tc_modname <process_name>
     This prevents writing to the trace until the first instruction in 
     the given module/process name starts, i.e., 
     the trace does not contain the process initialization

  4. (qemu) tracebyname <process_name> <trace_filename>
     This instructs TFD to start tracing when the given process starts

For example: 
  (qemu) tc_modname named.exe
  (qemu) tracebyname named.exe "/tmp/tmp.trace"

Then, start the process
