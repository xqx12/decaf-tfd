Compiling TFD under DECAF_1.2

0. Make sure you have correctly installed DECAF under some directory that 
   I will refer as DECAF_PATH
    For this, follow the instructions in DECAF_PATH/INSTALL 
    More help is available at:
      http://code.google.com/p/decaf-platform/wiki/DECAF

1. Compiling TFD
     cd TFD_PATH
     ./configure --decaf-path DECAF_PATH
     make

    This step should create a library called tfd.so under TFD_PATH
    The resulting TFD plugin supports v50 traces and v20 state files, 
    which are compatible with the ones in the Bitblaze Vine 1.0 release.
    If you want the latest v60 traces and v40 state files, use instead:
      ./configure --decaf-path DECAF_PATH --latest 
    or 
      ./configure --decaf-path DECAF_PATH --trace60 --state40

2. Compiling the hooks
     make hooks

    This step should create a number of hooks libraries (.so files) under
      TFD_PATH/hooks

3. Make sure that TFD_PATH and TFD_PATH/hooks are 
   both included in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. 
   These are needed because the plugin and hooks are dynamically loaded 
   using the 'load_plugin' or 'load_hooks' commands in the monitor, and 
   the will look only in the standard directories such as 
   /usr/lib and maybe /usr/local/lib


Configuring QEMU's network (tap) interface
==========================================
Create a script /etc/qemu-ifup, including the following lines:
#!/bin/sh
sudo /sbin/ifconfig $1 <ip_address> up

where <ip_address> is the address used by the host machine

This should allow you to run the tap interface as *root*

Start DECAF
===========
1. $sudo chmod 666 /dev/net/tun
2. $DECAF_PATH/i386-softmmu/qemu-system-i386 -m 512 -net nic,vlan=0 -net tap,vlan=0,script=/etc/qemu-ifup -monitor stdio -snapshot <image_file>

where <image_file> is an absolute path to the guest image
